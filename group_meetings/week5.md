The main aim for this week is to figure out what kind of story we want to tell with the data.
- How we are going about this so far is to look at each category and see what crimes it is correlated with
- Then, we can see where in QLD they occur
- We can then tell a story about these crimes and maybe the people commiting them

eg. Drug Offences are correlated with a lot of other crimes, such as tresspassing etc

Each of us should have a look and think about what kind of story we want to tell
