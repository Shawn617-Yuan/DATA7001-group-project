A quick summary of the main talking points and decisions
- We decided to go with the Queensland Crime Data idea 
- We will keep the Koala dataset as a backup in case the first idea doesnt pan out

    - We should integrate it into Jupyter notebooks for best readability
- James will talk to Ash in his contact hours to ask the following questions
    - What is the scope of the project?
    - How deep should our analsis go?
    - What kind of analysis should be done?
        - Do we report statistics?
        - Do we create heatmaps, graphs etc?
        - Should we create a model?
- It is important that we can keep to a good schedule for this project
- For the next week, we should each try to get a good feel for the data
    - See what relationships are available
    - See what preliminary conclusions we can make
    - Place the resulting notes in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qufFSkztehCpVqMZn7fj78Lx-cGuaJuEiv0CeXzcXLY/edit?usp=sharing)
